## Welcome 👋

This is open-source repository for all things related to BigData4Mobility. Our mission is to advance science and broaden impacts in using big mobile data for analyzing human mobility patterns. To do this, we: 

- Demonstrate the promises and limitations of using big mobile data for human mobility analysis;
- Fix problems in the big mobile data;
- Leverage big data to answer big questions.

Together, using the knowledge, models and algorithms generated above, we create technologies and tools for all.
